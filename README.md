# Chrome Custom Tabs

Chrome Custom Tabs give apps more control over their web experience, and make transitions between native and web content more seamless without having to resort to a WebView.
Chrome Custom Tabs allow an app to customize how Chrome looks and feels. An app can change things like:

~ Toolbar color

~ Enter and exit animations

~ Add custom actions to the Chrome toolbar, overflow menu and bottom toolbar
